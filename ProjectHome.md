# Description #
There is a nice example on how to write a simple but already powerful file sharing webserver for a local network: http://fragments.turtlemeat.com/pythonwebserver.php .

In particular, this is very useful if one wants to quickly exchange files with a mobile phone over WiFi (when there is no Internet connection or the traffic counts, etc).

This page contains a few improvements (hopefully) to the original code, where the most important is that we now upload the file under it's original filename.

It could also be useful as a working example of how to use Python <tt>cgi.FieldStorage</tt> component with a non-CGI Python webserver like SimpleHTTPServer .

This mini-project consists of three small parts:

  * this intro
  * a code snippet that you might want to take home )
  * links to some other related pages in this wiki and outside.

<a href='Hidden comment: 

...

The fourth part is a working piece of code in the Mercurial repository that is *not* recommended to take home - it is something made very quick and very dirty (and quite messy), and I was unwilling to waste any additional time on it since it worked for me. It is strongly advised to start with the code snippet and make something better

Despite the `<code>` tags, the above code could be distorted by the Google Wiki rendering engine, so here is a [link](http://python-simple-fileserver.googlecode.com/files/webserver.py) to the original file. (At the moment I do not see any point in putting it under the source control 했:-) )

In addition, you will need the [upload.html](http://python-simple-fileserver.googlecode.com/files/upload.html) file -- put it in the same folder as the "webserver.py" file, and run it with "python webserver.py" from the same folder.
Now point your browser to "127.0.0.1:8080/" to test things (Linux does not allow an ordinary user to take ports below 1024, so I have used port 8080) ; later don't forget to edit (or re-generate, etc) the "upload.html" file edit to replace the "127.0.0.1" address for the one by which your computer is accessed directly !
